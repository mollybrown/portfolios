# Molly Brown M2 Portfolio

## End of Module Reflection

Mod 2 was a great experience and much different challenge than Mod 1. Creating our first Rails apps and seeing our projects online was totally gratifying - here was our first real taste of web development. I expereinced probably the first group project that I have ever enjoying participating in with Bike Share, which was a very welcome suprise. I sent my first tweet (topic: how to screw up your Jekyll partials using capital letters)! I managed to finally finish the [Front-End Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) that I started nearly a year ago. I sucessfully stalked people on LinkedIn and GitHub and sent cold emails despite the fact it made me totally uncomfortable. I sent Sandi Metz a [postcard](https://www.sandimetz.com/99bottles/postcard) begging for a free "99 Bottles of OOP" book

However, combined with the process of creating our job trackers and sending cold emails the reality of how much work is still left to do beyond the coursework hit me pretty hard in the past few weeks. 

It was so gratifying to finally be able to see our projects online and feel like I was starting to get some respectable portfolio pieces up. I also was very pleasntly suprised by both of my group work expriences - I think I was traumatized by the idea of group work in my k-12 days and didn't really get over it until these past 6 weeks. While the pacing of the classes seemed much less overwhelming than in Mod 1, I defnitly worked hard as I was frantically attempting to finish up the Udacity FEND program at the same time, which I succeded in. As a result I learned a bunch of Javascript which did me no good in mod 2 (well, except in how to create the google map for bike share), but I trust my time will come in mod 4 :). The idea

## C: Professional Skills

### Gear Up
#### Microaggressions

I participated in the "Responding to Microaggressions" sub-group for this gear-up. For better or worse, while my converations about this topic were pretty uninspired during the gear-up itself, I went on to have multiple excellent and thoughful conversations about the material with other people from my mod in the subsequent weeks. We discussed how it has difficult to find a balance between calling people out on their micro-agressive actions while being not so aggressive in response that it puts people on the defensive, as well as distinguishing the difference between a "real" microaggression and a well-intentioned mistake. Ultimately our conversations seemed to resolve to the importance of exercising discirmination in not deliberatly seeking reasons to feel offended but also calling out poor behavior when it occurs.

#### Journey Mapping

The Journey Mapping was a neat concept, though I'm still not sure how it differs from the idea of creating a user story. Our group covered the process of the emotional up-and-downs of the improv session in Mod 1 and the process of getting a new driver's licence at the DMV. I think the biggest take away for me was the importance of empathy towards users in designing services, and how much many of our government services could stand to be improved in the regard.

#### Grit Mindset

To quote one of my group discussion members, grit is resiliance with an aspirational (passion) focus rather than an oppositional one. Again, I think it is useful to have the concept of grit to be able to have conversations about those character traits and motivations that allow us to overcome difficulties in life and grow, but so much of the material out there seems to totally miss the mark. Part of me wonders if the whole "life-hack" treatment of grit and resiliance is a result of children born of the positive self-esteem parenting style not being able to deal with failure and the disappointments of adulthood and desperately seeking positve affirmtions that we simply have to be more patient and more passionate and more ambitious and more focused to achieve the success that is supposedly our birthright. As someone who experienced the breakdown of this mindset in my 20's, I feel like it is was only through a period of _not_ striving/fighting/grasping for direction or passion that allowed me the space to come up with a definition of success that resonated with me personally and chart another course. I would so much rather see children being taught that it is ok and natural to feel lost or confused or not know what makes you tick than adding "passion" as yet another prerequsite that one needs to check off in order to live a meaningful life.

### Professional Development Workshops
#### Collaborative Communication
I volunteered to play PM for our bike share group as I had worked in an agile environment before and felt comfortable with the idea of creating user stories and cards to track progress on our project. In general I felt that the whole project went smoothly and thankfully my teammates were receptive to my attempts at keeping all of us on track. I think the best process we implemented was having a short retrospective at the beginning and end of each working session to make sure that we were all on the same page. Alternatively, I could have done a better job of using pomodoros to make sure that we did not work too long without taking a break and being more aggressive about prompting us to move on from certain issues.

The main constructive feedback I recieved from team members was, as I mentioned above, to not be shy about really owning my role as PM and making it clear to the group that we could not afford to spend any further time on a given issue. While I did some cajoling to move us in the right direction, I also held back in not wanting to interrupt the focus of the group and fear appearing to nag or be overbearing. In the end, I learned that my teammates were open to and even expected more "hearding" than I gave in the end. This prompted to me to consider that I should act more self-confidently in owning the roles I take on in projects and trust my team to tell me if I do something that they disagree with, rather than holding back.

#### Feedback II
Paragraph reflection in your portfolio on:

How you incorporated feedback from your team members and what you learned about yourself in the process

Activity #1: Complete the Johari Window activity using the adjectives you and your teammates identified for you ahead of time.

Analyze:

What do you notice about each quadrant?
For the Blind Spot quadrant, is there anything you’d like to build more awareness around? How will you do that?
Activity #2: Analyze feedback you’ve received from your most recent group project. Use the right & wrong spotting technique to recognize your feelings about the feedback and what could be done with it.

As you’re writing in the wrong column, think about:

What behavior did my partners see? Are there any blind spots I might have?
In the right column, make plans for how you can improve in the next team or pair project. Think about:

What is useful here?
What is something I want to work on from this feedback?

### Giving Feedback

*To Caroline Powell (Bike Share)*: Caroline, it was awesome working with you on the Bike Share project and I felt spoiled by having you on our team. You took the lead in working through the nuances of creating our database architecture and brought up issues and potential solutions that would have never occurred to me. You are also impressively tenacious about working through problems and researching solutions and testing them for effectiveness. My only suggestion for improvement would to be remain mindful of your ability to dig deeply into issues and stick to a time limit so that you do not end up dwelling on one particular issue for too long. Still, I was very impressed by your ability to consider each issue from many potential angles. Thanks for all your hard work and I hope I get the chance to work on a project with you again.

*To Ethan Bennett (Bike Share)*: Ethan, I felt like you were the most versatile member of our team and did an awesome job of offering help on every aspect of our project. I was particular impressed by your ability to jump into the visual design and structure of our website and put together a finished product that showcased our data very well in a short time frame. It was a huge confidence boost for me personally to know that we had a good-looking first project to showcase right from the start of Mod 2. My one suggestion for improvement would be to keep the lines of communication open with team members when working remotely. Again, thanks for all your work and being the swiss army knife of our team!

*To Mike Schutte (Bike Share)*: Mike, I am equally grateful for both the positive attitude and energy your contributed to our team as well as your carefully thought-out code. In particular I was really impressed by your work to keep up team morale as we worked late the night before the project was due and your ability to pitch in and help any of us work through code issues, despite the fact that were were all working on very different aspects of the project - it speaks highly of your skills with the concepts we have learned thus far. That being said, in future projects I would suggest that you remain mindful of the fact that your fluency with the material and desire to write the best code possible can sometimes conflict with the needs of your other team members to work through issues at their own speed. However, you also demonstrated that you are open and responsive to constructive feedback and make immediate changes as needed, which I have the utmost respect for. Thank you again for all you contributed and helping make our project and team finish strong.

### Being a Community Member

*From Caroline Powell*: I had the pleasure of working with Molly on the Bike Share project. We chose Molly to be our project manager and she did a great job keeping us organized and on track. In addition to being a great project manager, Molly was a real team asset on analytics methods and bonus extensions. One of Molly’s greatest strengths is that she is not afraid to go above and beyond and tackle new things with little guidance. She took the lead in figuring out the google maps API, and as a result we had a stunning index page that displayed the locations of each bike station in San Francisco. The map was a real wow factor that gave our site immediate visual appeal on a project very early on in our program at Turing.

*From Mike Schutte*: Molly, thank you for all your work as project manager. You did a fantastic job keeping us on track and productive. Additionally, I really respect how you were undaunted in figuring out the Google Map API, it really took our project to another level. On your next projects, I recommend making an effort to improve your attention to detail on factors such as changes in variable names in order to skip small and preventable bugs. Thanks again for being a great teammate, and good luck on your future projects.
